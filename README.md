I have purchased the book 'ตะลุยโจทย์ Python 500 ข้อ พร้อมเฉลยอย่างละเอียด' by Tautology after being inspired by Krin Chinprasatsak's video detailing his journey to becoming an AI scientist. I am using this book to practice all the Python problems and thoroughly study the solutions. This preparation is essential for my upcoming computer programming class at Chulalongkorn University, where I aim to excel in the test.
